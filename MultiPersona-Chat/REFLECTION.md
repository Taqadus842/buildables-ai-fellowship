# 🌟 Reflection

## 📚 What I Learned
- How to build a simple chatbot in Python.
- Difference between **mock testing** vs using a real API.
- How to structure a project with documentation (README & Reflection).
- How to simulate AI responses for free without using paid services.

## ⚡ Challenges
- Setting up OpenAI API in PyCharm (required billing & API key).
- Understanding how environment variables work.
- Making the chatbot professional while keeping it simple.

## 🛠️ Solutions
- Used a **mock function** to simulate chatbot replies (no API key needed).
- Documented installation & usage properly.
- Made the chatbot modular so it can be extended in the future.

## 🚀 Future Work
- Replace mock responses with **real GPT responses** once API access is available.
- Add better **conversation memory** so the chatbot remembers context.
- Improve **UI/UX** with a web interface.
- Explore **open-source LLMs** (LLaMA2, GPT4All) for free offline AI.
